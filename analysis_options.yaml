   # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
   # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`

   # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.

   # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
   # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
   # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
   # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
   # producing the lint.
